    <a href="./public/birthday-invite.html"><h3>My Birthday Website</h3></a>
    <p>A small little website I built in pure html (for that retro 90's feel) which shows users where and when my birthday is (and most importatly, makes them aware that they need to bring a present).</p>

    <a href="./public/movie-ranking.html"><h3>My Best Movies Website</h3></a>
    <p>A website to show off my top 3 movies of all time.  I bet these are some unusual choices for "top movie"</p>
